# Simple-SpeedTest-in-Pyhon
This code uses the 'subprocess.run' function to execute the 'speedtest-cli' command, and capture the output in a string. The string is then returned by the ''test_speed'' function and printed to the console to show the speedtest results. 


# REQUIREMENTS
To use this code, you need to install the 'speedtest-cli ' library using the ' pip install speedtest-cli ' OR ' py 'm pip install speedtest-cli ' command.
After installing the library, you can run the Python script from the console and follow the on-screen instructions to check the speed of your Internet connection
